To address this issue, we explored how four natural hazards, earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, and volcanoes, overlapped with the distribution ranges of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles that have either narrow distributions or populations with few mature individuals. To assess which species are at risk from these natural hazards, we combined the frequency and magnitude of each natural hazard to estimate their impact. We considered species at risk if they overlapped with regions where any of the four natural hazards historically occurred (n = 3,722). Those species with at least a quarter of their range subjected to a high relative impact were considered at high risk (n = 2,001) of extinction due to natural hazards. In total, 834 reptiles, 617 amphibians, 302 birds, and 248 mammals were at high risk and they were mainly distributed on islands and in the tropics. Hurricanes (n = 983) and earthquakes (n = 868) affected most species, while tsunamis (n = 272), and volcanoes (n = 171) affected considerably fewer. The region with the highest number of species at high risk was the Pacific Ring of Fire, especially due to volcanoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis, while hurricane-related high-risk species were concentrated in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and northwestern Pacific Ocean. Our study provides important information regarding the species at risk due to natural hazards and can help guide conservation attention and efforts to safeguard their survival.\r\nClick on the link below for further information about this paper: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2321068121\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Communal latrines are sites where multiple individuals of the same species defecate and can have multiple functions. Latrine behavior has been recorded in many animal species, including lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris), which consume a wide variety of plants and fruits and defecate large piles of dung, sometimes containing many seeds. Due to the concentration of seeds and other defecated material, latrines may thus serve as direct sources of food for other vertebrates, including insectivores feeding on invertebrates attracted to dung. Here, we studied which vertebrate animals were recorded foraging in tapir latrines, how long they spent foraging on latrines, and how their foraging behavior varied with the time of day and days since tapir defecation. Since tapirs are generalist foragers with a large diet breadth, we expected that their feces might attract vertebrate foragers with a variety of dietary habits (e.g., frugivores, granivores, omnivores, insectivores) in distinct foraging periods within a day. We also expected that the foraging events would be greatest in the days immediately following tapir defecation. We monitored 27 tapir latrines with camera traps for six months, recording foraging vs. non-foraging behaviors. We observed nine vertebrate species foraging in tapir latrines with five frequent foragers: the frugivores Guerlinguetus brasiliensis (50% of total foraging records) and Tinamus solitarius (16%, also a granivore) and the omnivores Turdus albicollis (18%), Chamaeza campanisona (10%) and Odontophorus capueira (6%). Foraging and non-foraging events throughout the day differed significantly for G. brasiliensis (p= 0.006), T. solitarius (p= 0.01), and C. campanisona (p= 0.001), and all species were diurnal, foraging between 05:00h and 18:00h. The foraging probability of C. campanisona and T. albicollis was affected by the time lapse since tapir defecation. Our study highlights that communal latrines such as those maintained by lowland tapirs can be an important resource supply for some vertebrate consumers with different diets and could contribute to maintaining diversity in tropical forests. We call for future studies to inspect the importance of latrines as foraging sites for other species and ecosystems.\r\nClick on the link below for further information about this paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2024.e02950\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nBackground\r\nI created this project as the final assignment for the Introduction to Infographics and Data Visualization course I took at the University of Miami (JMM622-O)\r\nFor this project, I focused on the Atlantic Forest and analyzed the correlation between the number of peer-reviewed papers and the number of species. To collect the necessary data, I used the ATLANTIC: Data Papers from a biodiversity hotspot section of the Ecology scientific journal, which includes all available data on specific species. To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the data, I only used the published data.\r\nI attempted to create a visual representation of the loss of forest cover in the Brazilian state using a bubble chart, with the canopy as the main theme. Below the chart, I added a heat map to show the number of published papers per year, starting from the first published paper. Although my choice of chart was primarily based on design aesthetics, I wanted to convey the message effectively. I wanted to visually represent the growth of publications over time using a tree trunk. I noticed that there was a pattern of an increasing number of publications in recent years, and so I used the color brown to represent years with fewer publications. This allowed me to create a gradient transition from the top to the bottom of the tree trunk using the same hue.\r\nI used the Sankey diagram chart to split the published papers into groups based on the number of publications per animal group and the number of recorded species per year. My aim was to demonstrate that the diversity of organisms is the foundation of the tropical forest. Using the Sankey diagram, I wanted to highlight that some species have been studied more than others and that there is a correlation between the number of studies and the number of species recorded by year. Essentially, the more research we undertake, the more species we discover. For small animal groups, it appears that we have not yet reached the expected number of species. I used linear charts to depict the number of published papers and recorded species over time, linking them to their respective Sankey curves.\r\nMotivation\r\nI chose this topic because I have noticed that some species get more attention than others. From the outset, I aimed to create a stylish infographic that would depict my data as a tree. The reason was to get more attention to the topic beyond the use of charts and graphics. In the past, we used to analyze the impact of human activity on forests through linear or bar charts. However, these charts didn’t provide a complete picture of the complex relationships between different factors. As a result, we may have become too accustomed to these charts and stopped paying attention to the details. To address this issue, I created an infographic that incorporates various types of charts to create a more engaging and informative presentation. The goal was to create something that people would find visually appealing while also providing valuable insights into the impact of human activity on forests. After analyzing the Sankey chart along with the linear charts, I believe that charts showing absolute information might obscure vital information that temporal charts can capture. By examining these charts, we can identify what ecologists refer to as “Cute species,” which are species that have an emotional impact on humans, such as primate species that are more closely related to human origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following file contains the step-by-step processes I utilized to create the definitive infographic. The infographic was based on my knowledge of the topic, as well as weekly feedback from my professor. This file also contains the pipeline I employed to manipulate, clean, and process the data utilizing R Markdown.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can check the infographic and scripts used to create it as well as the files by accessing it through my GitHub repository\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This is a versatile topic that can be explored in many ways. Additionally, it helped through the processes of using different charts to tell a story from a broad to a narrow perspective using Adobe Illustrator and infographic techniques. The data was obtained from National Center for Homeless Education portal and the infographic is divided into four main sections.\r\nThe first section features a line chart showing the total number of homeless students between 2009 and 2021. I chose a line chart because it makes it easier to track trends over time. Alongside the chart, I added a map of the number of homeless students per county in New York State. I chose to use counties to illustrate that this problem is widespread throughout the state.\r\nGiven that New York has 62 counties and it would be hard to make a chart representing each of them\r\nwell, in the second section I tried to show these changes using the New York economic region’s boundaries.\r\nI chose a line graph to display the data over time, as it shows the trends in the increased proportions of multiple areas simultaneously. In addition, by plotting both chart and map, I was able to avoid any overlapping lines within the chart and provide a clearer representation of the data. The map shows the proportionate increase in the number of homeless students in 2021 compared to 2009, per economic region. My aim in using both chart and map was to demonstrate that the rise in homeless students is not related to the size of the region, and that looking only at the percentage increase does not provide an accurate representation of the number of students affected in each region.\r\nIn the third section, I use a line chart to show which schools these students attend and how disproportionate it is over time. I also included a bar chart showing the proportion changes in 2021 compared to 2009.\r\nIn the fourth and final section of my project, I present the proportion of students per school grade over time using a bumpchart. I chose the bumpchart because it allows me to display the overlap between lines and trends more effectively than the line chart. Additionally, this section includes a bar chart comparing the year 2021 to 2009 for each grade. As I do not have data regarding students’ age, I used grades as a proxy to estimate the age of individuals living in homeless conditions.\r\nMotivation\r\nI chose this topic because young people are likely the social class most affected by homelessness, as they must make decisions that will impact their adult lives. Additionally, the United States has plenty of available data that allowed me to explore this topic from different angles. The infographic is based on The Economist magazine’s style.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following file contains the step-by-step processes I utilized to create the definitive infographic. This file also contains the pipeline I employed to manipulate, clean, and process the data utilizing R Markdown.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can check the infographic and scripts used to create it as well as the files by accessing it through my GitHub repository\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I also created a Storytelling using ArcGIS that you can interact with the maps and get some more details about our research, you can access it by clicking here\r\nAbstract\r\nTermites are considered important ecosystem engineers and drivers of patterns and processes observed in savannas and tropical forests worldwide. Even recognizing their importance for ecosystem functioning and balance, we lack fundamental information (such as the species composition) about these invertebrates in the Brazilian Savanna, which constrains us in advance of robust and proper measurements of their importance in such an important and unique ecosystem. Therefore, we aim to survey and sample termites in the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park (CVNP), a heterogeneous savanna comprising different guilds of termites and their structures, such as mounds and earthmounds. This park has areas ranging from flatted grasslands and forests to high mountain rocks, in which the seasonality and the shallow soil might turn the landscape into a mix of wet and dry ecosystems. The first part of my project will focus on identifying termites’ species composition, abundance, and distribution across this gradient of different areas of CVNP. In the second part, we propose to enlighten the underlying processes of termites’ role in soil biogeochemistry patterns using the environmental and local scale gradients, from nest-mounds and earthmounds to surrounding fields. For the first part, we will collect termites using survey protocols, such as linear transect and baits. The second part compares termites’ activity as drivers of soil nutrient composition, organic matter, moisture, soil structure, and carbon dioxide and methane gas flux. We hypothesize that the soil dynamic will vary according to termite composition over the CVNP. Thus, places with more termite activity would have richer nutrient soils and more atmospheric gas flux.\r\nUnfortunately, our poster size is too large, so can not load it in a high resolution on this post.

Such sites favor colonization by plants and by termites, which play a significant role in ecosystem dynamics and maintenance through organic matter decomposition and gas fluxes.

For this, we will perform a literature review to understand the role of such islands worldwide, and we will conduct fieldwork and data collection in the Brazilian Savanna Cerrado, focusing on the Campos de Murundus islands.

However, there is an increasing recognition that terrestrial tortoises could also be considered important seed dispersers in many ecosystems. The red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria) is one of the largest terrestrial tortoises in South America and is thought to disperse large seeds. However, little is known about their role as seed dispersers, and their potential use as restorers of defaunated areas. Here, we assessed the maximum width of seeds this species could ingest, the mean gut retention time (GRT), and the post-consumption germination capacity for tropical fruit species. Forty different fruit species were offered to eight captive individuals, obtaining a maximum seed width swallowed of 23 mm. We used four native plant species to measure the GRT within four tortoises, and we found a mean retention time of 18.92 ± 4.81 days. We also found that sex is an important indicator of GRT, with females presenting longer retention periods. This novel finding may be due to the higher metabolic defecating and dispersing rates of males. Although germination proportions varied between the four plant species used in the experiment, overall defecated seeds germinated faster than control seeds. We conclude that red-footed tortoises are potentially important seed dispersers due to their ability to swallow a large quantity and size of seeds while accelerating seed germination rates. This species should be considered a viable ecological substitute for large frugivores in rewilding projects, as C. carbonaria performs similar functions to large dispersers that have been extirpated due to defaunation processes.\r\nClick on the link below for further information about this paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2022.103837\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The final result was very useful and pleasurable because I learned a lot. But first, let me tell you about the motivation for this App.\r\nI worked with a group led by Dr. Marina Cortês. This group collected data from fieldwork and literature, with people collaborating from different places in the world. The data consist of plant attributes/traits. One of the challenges of this kind of work is keeping the data structure since different places use dots and commas differently. You probably have experienced opening an Excel table, and the data was like a mess with small numbers or coordinates represented as it was money information. This group was facing this problem. So, there was a need for a platform that could receive and integrate the data without any problem with data formatting.\r\nThe way we found to solve this issue was by creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app. The idea was to create a platform with tabs and options in which the user does not need to write, they just need to select, then decrease problems such as word formatting or number punctuation. However, these data needed to be stored in some database with real updating to avoid data overlapping or input duplication, and here my problem starts.\r\nI started the app using the Tychobra tutorial. I chose this one because 1) it was the only example available on the internet, and 2) it has an option for login, which allowed only give access to those people who were working with input data. This login option also allowed me to track the person who entered the data, making it possible to ask them about some mistakes or details on the data. However, this tutorial uses the SQLite database structure, which hosts the data locally and uses SQL structure, something I have never heard of before. So, to solve it, I needed to find a SQL structure that stores the data remotely, and I found my answer in the MySQL method through this tutorial.\r\nAt this point, I had answered two questions about my project: 1- which app structure I should use, and 2- where to store data. However, I figured it would take something necessary to intermediate the information exchange, and then I had to learn about servers. I needed to find a way to connect my table in MySQL to the app visual structure on R. I found my answer on Amazon AWS.\r\nUnfortunately, Amazon AWS is a paid server. Fortunately, it gives you 1-years of free tests. The app I show here is not on AWS anymore because my license expired. However, you can find it on my YouTube channel and check what the final version looks like.\r\nThe version I present here (https://souzayuri.shinyapps.io/CRUD_app/) is the one before I used MySQL and can give you some insights into this powerful data-collection tool and its potential to facilitate team collaborations.

Although the abundance and distribution of different plant growth forms can be strongly determined by factors such as climate and soil composition, large mammalian herbivores have a strong impact on plant communities, thus defaunation (the local or functional extinction of large animals) has the potential to alter the compositional structure of plant growth forms in natural ecosystems. Tropical rainforests sustain a high diversity of growth forms, including trees, palms, lianas, shrubs, herbs and bamboos, all of which play important ecosystem functions. Here, we experimentally evaluate how large mammalian herbivores affect the dominance, diversity and coexistence of these major tropical forest plant growth forms, by monitoring communities of saplings on the understorey in 43 paired exclusion plots in a long-term replicated exclusion experiment in the understorey of the Atlantic forest of Brazil. Over the course of 10 years large herbivore exclusion decreased diversity among growth forms, increased the absolute abundance of palms and trees (22% and 38% respectively) and increased the diversity of species within these two groups, to the detriment of other growth forms. Furthermore, all pairwise relationships between growth forms were positive on plots where herbivores had access, whereas several strong negative relationships emerged in plots where herbivores were excluded. This occurred despite strong background directional temporal trends affecting plant communities in both experimental treatments across the region. Synthesis. Our work indicates that the defaunation alters growth form dominance by favouring palms and trees while eroding diversity among growth forms and coexistence on a temporal scale. Large herbivore mammals promote diversity among growth forms, preventing the hyper-dominance of trees and palms, yet without supressing the diversity of species within growth forms. We argue that large herbivore mammals affect growth forms through several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms, including herbivory, seed dispersal and physical disturbance, as well as differential effects linked to the morphological and physiological adaptations of growth forms. We conclude that defaunation might lead to profound impacts on important ecosystem functions underpinned by growth form diversity, and result in vertical and horizontal structural simplification of tropical rainforests.\r\nClick on the link below for further information about this paper: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2745.13846\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

After five centuries of European human expansion, most Atlantic Forest landscapes are archipelagos of small forest fragments surrounded by open-habitat matrices. In this chapter, we describe the causes and consequences of large-scale defaunation in the Atlantic Forest of South America. We identify and quantify the magnitude of the main anthropogenic drivers of defaunation and stimulate a debate on how to revert the loss of fauna to restore biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services. The magnitude of the impact of defaunation in the Atlantic Forest is hard to estimate, but we can predict that, at large scale, habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation are the most common threats to terrestrial populations. Other threats vary in importance according to the taxonomic group. In general, apex predators, other carnivores, large-bodied mammals, and large herbivores were among the most defaunated functional groups and the loss of these animals has also a strong impact on the ecosystem services. Given the extent of the consequences of defaunation in the Atlantic Forest, mitigation strategies are imperative. Habitat restoration would clearly be effective in building space for defaunation mitigation but reversing the pervasive defaunation that occurred in the Atlantic Forest is by no means a straightforward task. Nonetheless, it will be fundamental to assure the persistence of the biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest remnants.\r\nClick on the link below for further information about this chapter: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55322-7_14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The Atlantic Forest of South America is home to around 334 species of small-, medium-, and large-sized mammals, and is currently restricted to less than 12% of its original cover. Here, we present the ATLANTIC MAMMALS, an open data set on information on medium- and large-sized mammal assemblages in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. A total of 129 studies were compiled, including published and in press peer-reviewed papers, book chapters, theses and unpublished data. We mapped 244 assemblages, eight orders, 63 genera, and 94 species (24 of which are classified as threatened by the IUCN Red List) distributed in 128 protected and 116 unprotected areas. Species richness of the mammalian assemblages varied from 1 to 39 species (mean 15).

We present a data set containing information about amphibian communities sampled throughout the Atlantic Forest Biome in South America. The data were extracted from 389 bibliographic references (articles, books, theses, and dissertations) representing inventories of amphibian communities from 1940 to 2017. The data set includes 17,619 records of 528 species with taxonomic certainty, from 1,163 study sites. Of all the records, 14,450 (82%) were classified using the criterion of endemism; of those, 7,787 (44%) were considered endemic and 6,663 (38%) were not. Historically, multiple sampling methods were used to survey amphibians, the most representative methods being active surveys (82.1%), surveys at breeding sites (20%), pitfall traps (15.3%), and occasional encounters (14.5%). Species richness averaged 15.2 ± 11.3 (mean ± SD), ranging from 1 to 80 species per site. We found a low dominance in the communities, with 10 species occurring in about 26% of communities: Physalaemus cuvieri (4.1%), Dendropsophus minutus (3.8%), Boana faber (3.1%), Scinax fuscovarius (2.8%), Leptodactylus latrans (2.7%), Leptodactylus fuscus (2.6%), Boana albopunctata (2.3%), Dendropsophus nanus (1.6%), Rhinella ornata (1.6%), and Leptodactylus mystacinus (1.6%). This data set represents a major effort to compile inventories of amphibian communities for the Neotropical region, filling a large gap in the data on the Atlantic Forest hotspot. We hope this data set can be used as a credible tool in the proposal of new studies on amphibian sampling and even in the development of conservation planning for these taxa. This information also has great relevance for macroecological studies, being foundational for both conservation and restoration strategies in this biodiversity hotspot.

Of this total, 1% is in the state of São Paulo, on private properties or protected in conservation units. In view of these environmental conditions and the richness of this system, the Cerrado is considered one of the 25 most important terrestrial sites for conservation. Despite conservation efforts, this domain is plagued by the invasion of exotic species such as the Pinus genus. Considering the importance of life history knowledge for the mitigation of exotic species, we sought to investigate the history of invasion by Pinus in wetlands at the Ecological Station of Itirapina, SP, using near infrared reflectance (NIR) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the period 1985–2011. Our results showed that areas with high occupation of Pinus spp. have a higher NIR reflectance value, and that such reflectance varied over the analyzed period, as well as between the areas occupied by Pinus spp. Despite this variation, the results from the NDVI showed a linear increase in the density and biomass of this vegetation for the same period, indicating that spatial limitations do not affect the development of Pinus spp. The use of NIR and NDVI measurements together proved to be a good tool for studies aiming to understand temporal patterns of invasion.\r\nClick on the link below for further information about this paper: https://periodicos.ufpe.br/revistas/rbgfe/article/view/234195/29379\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
